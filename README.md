### Contents covered:
> 1. A Brief History of Modern AI and its Applications
> 2. Retrieving Data, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Feature Engineering
> 3. Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing

### Project requirements:
> ...spend some time finding a data set that you are really passionate about. This can be a data set similar to the data you have available at work or data you have always wanted to analyze. For some people this will be sports data sets, while some other folks prefer to focus on data from a datathon or data for good.
>
> Once you have selected a data set, you will produce the deliverables listed below and submit them to one of your peers for review. Treat this exercise as an opportunity to produce analysis that are ready to highlight your analytical skills for a senior audience, for example, the Chief Data Officer, or the Head of Analytics at your company.
> Sections required in your report:
> - Brief description of the data set and a summary of its attributes
> - Initial plan for data exploration
> - Actions taken for data cleaning and feature engineering
> - Key Findings and Insights, which synthesizes the results of Exploratory Data Analysis in an insightful and actionable manner
> - Formulating at least 3 hypothesis about this data
> - Conducting a formal significance test for one of the hypotheses and discuss the results 
> - Suggestions for next steps in analyzing this data
> - A paragraph that summarizes the quality of this data set and a request for additional data if needed
